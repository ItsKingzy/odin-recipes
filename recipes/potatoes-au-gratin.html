            <li>Prepare a large casserole dish by greasing the inside of the dish using salted butter &#40;optionally you could use any spray-on grease to grease the inside of the pan&#41;</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400&deg; fahrenheit.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll need a mandoline for this next step.</strong> Prepare each potato by peeling then any way you would like. Then use a mandoline to slice the potatoes into even 1/8" slices. Repeat for every potato. <em>If you don't have access to a kitchen mandoline, you can carefully cut the potatoes into even 1/8" slices as best as possible using a kitchen knife.</em></li>
