            <li>Prepare a large casserole dish by greasing the inside of the dish using salted butter &#40;optionally you could use any spray-on grease to grease the inside of the pan&#41;</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400&deg; fahrenheit.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll need a mandoline for this next step.</strong> Prepare each potato by peeling then any way you would like. Then use a mandoline to slice the potatoes into even 1/8" slices. Repeat for every potato. <em>If you don't have access to a kitchen mandoline, you can carefully cut the potatoes into even 1/8" slices as best as possible using a kitchen knife.</em></li>
            <li>Now prepare the cheeses &#40;both the sharp cheedar cheese and the gruyere&#41; by grading a cup of each, then set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Now switching gears, after slicing all the potatoes, start heating 2 tbsp of salted butter in a pot on medium heat so we can make the roux.</li>
            <li>Once butter is melted, gradually add in about 2 or 3 tbsp of flour to create a roux while constantly stiring the roux until it's nice and clumpy.</li>
            <li>Then, gradually add in about 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of half/half cream, and 1 cup of chicken broth into your roux while constantly stiring. After a little while, you'll start to notice the roux thicken.</li>
            <li>Once the roux is lightly thickened, gradually add in your cheeses that you graded earlier and mix thoroughly. It will thicken fast!</li>
            <li>Once you notice that all the cheese has completely melted in the pot and the cheese sauce is nice and thick, set aside as we will use this later to layer the potatoes.</li>
