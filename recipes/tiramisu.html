            <li>Prepare the Vanilla JELL-O according to its package's directions either by microwave or by stovetop. Then whisk marscarpone cheese and coffee liqueur into the hot JELL-O mixture.</li>
            <li>Cover the JELL-O mixture with plastic wrap and let cool for an hour.</li>
            <li>Next, combine coffee granules, hot water, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Brush over the ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>After preparing the ladyfingers, fold the whipped topping into the pudding mixture.</li>
            <li>Line the bottom of an 8 cup trifle bowl with half of the ladyfingers you prepared earlier.</li>
            <li>Then, evenly spread half of the pudding mixture over the ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Once you're satisfied with the spread of the pudding mixture, sprinkle half of the grated chocolate evenly over the pudding spread.</li>
            <li>Repeat the last 4 steps for the second half of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill the dessert for 4 hours (<em>or overnight</em>) to blend in the flavours.</li>
