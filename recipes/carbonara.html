            -->
            <li>Prepare a large pot with around 4-6 cups of water inside. Place your 350g of spaghetti in the pot and heat on high. Let boil while you prepare other food.</li>
            <li>In the mean time, start grating your cheeses. Grate 1/3 cup of pecorino romano and set aside, do the same for 1/3 cup parmesan.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, add in your 2 egg yolks and whisk until you achieve a consistent yellow colour.</li>
            <li>Then, add in 1 cup of 1% milk and mix well with a fork or whisk.</li>
            <li>Then, add in your grated cheeses (1/3 cup grated pecorino romano and 1/3 cup grated parmesan) from the earlier steps. Mix well with a fork or whisk.</li>
            <li>Finally, in the same bowl, add in a bit of ground black pepper (to your liking) to add some extra flavour. Set aside for now.</li>
            <li>Check on your spaghetti, by now the spaghetti should almost be prepared to used. So, drain <strong><em>most</em></strong> of your spaghetti water, but set aside a small portion (about a cup).</li>
            <li>In the time being, heat a pan on medium heat and add in your 1/3 cup bacon bits and begin cooking them.</li>
            <li>Once you have obtained a desired crispiness to the bacon, add your spaghetti into the pan alongside the small portion of spaghetti water you saved earlier. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Subsequently, adjust the heat setting for the pan to low add gradually add in your cheese sauce you made ealier to the pan and mix constantly.</li>
            <li><strong>NOTE:</strong><em>you don't want to make a clumpy cheese sauce in the pan, so once you see parts of the sauce start to clump up, immediately take the pan off from the heat and place carbonara into a seperate serving dish.</em></li>
        </ol>

        <p>And just like that! You have successfully made a super delicious dish, perfect for any occassion. Enjoy!</p>
